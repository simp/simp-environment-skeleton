These scripts can be used to act as a fake CA.

Enter the hostnames of the certificates that you wish to create in the file
'togen', one per line and run the 'gencerts_nopass.sh' script.

If you wish to use alternate DNS names, separate the names with commas and no
spaces like the following example:

   primary.name,alt.name.1,alt.name.2,ip.addr.1,ip.addr.2

To generate user certificates, add users to the 'usergen' file in the following
format (one per line) and run the 'usergen_nopass.sh' script.

   username  email-address

The output of usergen will be placed in 'output/users'.

Run the 'clean.sh' script to reset to a clean state.

You can set the 'KEYDIST' environment variable to change the default output
directory for generated certificates.

    KEYDIST=/my/target/dir ./gencerts_nopass.sh

You can pass 'auto' as a command line argument to gencerts_nopass.sh
or usergen_nopass.sh, to use defaults when it first creates the CA.

    ./gencerts_nopass.sh auto

       or

    ./usergen_nopass.sh atuo

* Otherwise, you will be prompted for the CA-specific information the
  first time either script is run.
* The default values are set by the CA script.
