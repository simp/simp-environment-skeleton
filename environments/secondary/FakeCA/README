These scripts can be used to act as a fake CA.

Enter the hostnames of the certificates that you wish to create in the file
'togen', one per line and run the 'gencerts.sh' script.

If you wish to use alternate DNS names, separate the names with commas and no
spaces like the following example:

   primary.name,alt.name.1,alt.name.2,ip.addr.1,ip.addr.2

To generate user certificates, add users to the 'usergen' file in the following
format (one per line) and run the 'usergen.sh' script.

   username  email-address

The output of usergen will be placed in 'output/users'.

Run the 'clean.sh' script to reset to a clean state.

You can set the 'KEYDIST' environment variable to change the default output
directory for generated certificates.

    KEYDIST=/my/target/dir ./gencerts_nopass.sh
